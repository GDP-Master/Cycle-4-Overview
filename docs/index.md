# Overview

<!--img class="overview-image" src=""-->

This cycle, we'll work on how to present your work in progress. There are a number of ways that we would be doing this in "normal times" – here are some examples:
* Demonstrating a game on your computer in Game Lab or Unity.
* Sharing a link to a Game Lab project.
* Keeping your code up to date on GitHub.
* Building and publishing a WebGL version of a Unity game.

But these aren't normal times. So what can we do? It will depend on the project that you've selected and the tools that you have access to and know (or can figure out) how to use.
